    <h1>General Guatemalan History</h1>
        <h4>1990's to 2000's: Birth of the Internet post Civil War</h4>
        <p>Academically, Guatemala was first introduced to the internet via academic institutions in 1990. The importance of this is that Guatemala was still in their Civil War, which took place from 1960-1996). 

From here, the internet spread through other academic institutions, and internet cafes even became a thing, into the 2000’s. Well-known publications, such as Prensa Libre, were able to move online, letting more people with access to internet cafes, an easier way to gather information and become more connected.  </p>
        
        <h4>2000-2010: Political and Digital Activism</h4>
        <p>The availability of the internet allowed for the average citizen to watch and understand what was going on, close to real-time, rather than previous concerns regarding propaganda. 

The Guatemala National Police Archives (discovered in 2005) contained records of forced disappearances and military operations. Digitization efforts made these documents available to human rights organizations, lawyers, and international courts.

2011: The election of President Otto Pérez Molina saw increased discussion on social media about corruption and governance.
</p>
        <h4>2010 To the Present</h4>
        <p>The internet played a crucial role in the prosecution of General Efraín Ríos Montt, Guatemala’s former dictator who was convicted of genocide and crimes against humanity in 2013.</p>
<p>Human rights organizations digitized historical records of massacres committed under Ríos Montt’s rule (1982–1983).

The Guatemalan National Police Archives and U.S. declassified documents were made available online, revealing military orders and connections to state-sponsored violence.

The entire trial was broadcast online, allowing Guatemalans and the international community to watch proceedings in real time. This prevented political interference and exposed the judicial process to global scrutiny.

Live Streaming helped counter efforts to delay or dismiss the case, making it harder for political elites to suppress justice.

On May 10, 2013, Ríos Montt was convicted of genocide—the first time a former head of state was found guilty in his own country.

The internet helped to do this. </p>
